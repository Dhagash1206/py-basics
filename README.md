# Python Basics - Learning Repository

This repository contains Python implementations of fundamental data structures and object-oriented programming concepts.

## Contents

- **Stack Implementation** (`stack.py`) - Interactive menu-driven stack operations
- **Queue Implementation** (`queue.py`) - Interactive menu-driven queue operations
- **Linked List** (`linked-list.py`) - Singly linked list with insert, delete, display operations
- **Doubly Linked List** (`Doubly-linked-list.py`) - Doubly linked list implementation
- **OOP Banking System** (`OOPS`) - Demonstrates OOP concepts with a banking system
- **Credit Card Validator** (`credit-card.py`) - Credit card validation utility
- **Weather API** (`weather_api.py`) - Weather API integration example

## Workspace Setup

This repository includes a VS Code workspace configuration (`py-basics.code-workspace`) with:

- Python development settings
- Recommended extensions for Python development
- Debug configurations for each Python file
- Code formatting and linting settings

### Opening the Workspace

To use this workspace in VS Code:

1. Open VS Code
2. File â†’ Open Workspace from File
3. Select `py-basics.code-workspace`

### Recommended Extensions

The workspace recommends the following VS Code extensions:
- Python (ms-python.python)
- Pylance (ms-python.vscode-pylance)
- Black Formatter (ms-python.black-formatter)
- Pylint (ms-python.pylint)
- IntelliCode (visualstudioexptteam.vscodeintellicode)

## Running the Programs

Each Python file can be run independently:

```bash
python3 stack.py
python3 queue.py
python3 linked-list.py
python3 Doubly-linked-list.py
python3 OOPS
```

Or use the debug configurations in VS Code for an enhanced debugging experience.

## Development

This workspace is configured with:
- **Format on save** using Black formatter
- **Line rulers** at 80 and 120 characters
- **Automatic exclusion** of `__pycache__` and `.pyc` files
- **Basic type checking** with Pylance
- **Pytest** for testing (when tests are added)
